Finally I've taken my first paid plunge into learning Ruby language. For the next 7 weeks I'll be totally immersed in coding Ruby under the guidance of [Satish Talim](http://satishtalim.com/).

Even thought I'm using Ruby professionally, I'm far away from even being called an intermediate developer in it. It all started as helping out testers once in a while and soon I fell in love with the language. In order to be more able, I've been through [Codecademy Ruby track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) which gave me nice jumpstart to what I was doing at work. I languished at various other sites and tutorials before I decided it's better to take some professional help and shell out some moolah.

I had been reading [Ruby Learning blog](http://rubylearning.com/blog/) for some time now and was waiting for their next batch to start. I was still in dilemma between above and [Pragmatic Studio](http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby). Eventually, it all boiled down to cost of course and since I could afford this without reiterating my monthly budget, it was a clear winner.

Along with this, I'm planning to do some code katas at [Code Wars](http://www.codewars.com/) and also learn some more stuff at [Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com/).

I see myself as a better Ruby Developer and a step closer to get that Rails Developer job after this course. Lets hope for the best.
