</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Finally I've taken my first paid plunge into learning Ruby language. For the next 7 weeks I'll be totally immersed in coding Ruby under the guidance of <a href="http://satishtalim.com/">Satish Talim</a>.</p>
<p>Even thought I'm using Ruby professionally, I'm far away from even being called an intermediate developer in it. It all started as helping out testers once in a while and soon I fell in love with the language. In order to be more able, I've been through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby">Codecademy Ruby track</a> which gave me nice jumpstart to what I was doing at work. I languished at various other sites and tutorials before I decided it's better to take some professional help and shell out some moolah.</p>
<p>I had been reading <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/">Ruby Learning blog</a> for some time now and was waiting for their next batch to start. I was still in dilemma between above and <a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby">Pragmatic Studio</a>. Eventually, it all boiled down to cost of course and since I could afford this without reiterating my monthly budget, it was a clear winner.</p>
<p>Along with this, I'm planning to do some code katas at <a href="http://www.codewars.com/">Code Wars</a> and also learn some more stuff at <a href="https://rubymonk.com/">Ruby Monk</a>.</p>
<p>I see myself as a better Ruby Developer and a step closer to get that Rails Developer job after this course. Lets hope for the best.</p>                </article>
